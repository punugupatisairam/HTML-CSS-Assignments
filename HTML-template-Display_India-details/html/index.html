                            unique characteristics and contributions to the world. In China, the world's most
                            populous country, over 1.4 billion people call this vast land home, making it a
                            powerhouse in the global economy. Meanwhile, the United States, with its population
                            of approximately 331 million, boasts the largest economy globally, shaping trends in
                            technology, innovation, and culture. India, another Asian giant, with a population
                            exceeding 1.3 billion, is renowned for its rich history and cultural heritage. In
                            South America, Brazil spans a colossal 8.5 million square kilometers and is a hub of
                            biodiversity and economic activity. Russia, the largest country by land area, covers
                            17 million square kilometers, playing a crucial role in global geopolitics. Across
                            the African continent, Nigeria stands out with over 206 million people, contributing
                            significantly to the continent's economic growth. Turning to Asia, Japan's
                            technological prowess and rich traditions shine in a land of 126 million
                            inhabitants. Australia, with its unique wildlife and vast landscapes, is a key
                            player in the Asia-Pacific region. South Africa, with a population of approximately
                            60 million, is a beacon of economic development on the African continent. Lastly,
                            the United Kingdom, with its historical significance, influences global affairs with
                            a population of around 67 million. Each of these nations adds a vibrant thread to
                            the intricate fabric of our interconnected world."

                            India, officially the Republic of India (ISO: BhƒÅrat Ga·πáarƒÅjya),[21] is a country in
                            South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country as
                            of June 2023;[22][23] and from the time of its independence in 1947, the world's
                            most populous democracy.[24][25][26] Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the
                            Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land
                            borders with Pakistan to the west;[j] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and
                            Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of
                            Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border
                            with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.

                            Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000
                            years ago.Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as
                            hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human
                            genetic diversity. Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins
                            of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley
                            Civilisation of the third millennium BCE. By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit,
                            an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest. Its evidence
                            today is found in the hymns of the Rigveda. Preserved by an oral tradition that was
                            resolutely vigilant, the Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in India. The
                            Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions. By
                            400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[36] and
                            Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to
                            heredity.Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta
                            Empires based in the Ganges Basin. <SPAN id="tid"></SPAN>
